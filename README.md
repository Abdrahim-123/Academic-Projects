Explain what this project expects from me, what profound knowledge should I have to begin with the project and where can I learn those skillsets. Provide me an overall workflow to complete this project. I just have days and i have to complete this project from the scratch

[Gemini]:
Based on the project document you provided, here is a breakdown of what is expected, the knowledge you need, and a workflow to complete it under a tight deadline.

### 🎯 What This Project Expects From You

This project, "Lexical Analysis," requires you to build a **scanner** (also known as a lexical analyzer) using the **Flex** tool. Your scanner will read C-- source code (`.cmm` files) and break it down into a stream of tokens.

Would you like me to clarify any specific requirement, such as the output format for errors or the definitions for the number tokens?
